## 2pc-mpc

This crate is the official pure-Rust implementation of
the ["2PC-MPC: Emulating Two Party ECDSA in Large-Scale MPC"](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/253) paper by

- Offir Friedman, dWallet Labs
- Avichai Marmor, dWallet Labs

- Omer Sadika, dWallet Labs
- Yehonatan C. Scaly, dWallet Labs

It provides the distributed key generation (`dkg`), `presign` and `sign` protocols for a multiparty ECDSA under the
novel
2PC-MPC access structure: a two-party ECDSA where the second party is fully emulated by a network of n parties.
Designed with the use case of _dWallets_ in mind, where a user signs transactions with a massively decentralized
network [the dWallet Network](https://dwallet.io), the _2PC_ protocol is:

- non-collusive: both the centralized party (the user) and (a threshold) of the decentralized party (network) are
  required to
  participate in signing, while abstracting away the internal structure of the decentralized party.
- locality: centralized party is O(1): communication and computation complexities of the client remain independent of
  the network properties (e.g., size).
  Not fully implemented due to a restriction in Bulletproofs, which are not aggregatable range proofs.
  It Will be fixed in the future.

The _MPC_ protocol, where the decentralized party emulates the second party in the _2PC_ protocol, is:

- UC secure: meaning it is secure for composition with other UC protocols and allows multiple sessions to execute in
  parallel.
- broadcast-only: no P2P/unicast communication, instead this protocol assumes a reliable broadcast channel exclusively.
- Identifiable Abort: malicious behavior aborts the protocol identifiably, which is extremely important
  for use-cases where there is no trust between the parties so that no party can deny (DOS) the ability to sign in
  multiparty without being identified.
- publicly verifiable: a session's result, whether it terminates in a successful output or in an identifiable abort, can
  be cryptographically verified publicly, so anyone (even if they are not a party in the protocol) can verify the
  result from that session's transcript, containing the (signed) messages sent by all parties in that session.
- scalable & massively-decentralized:
    - O(n) communication: linear-scaling in communication.
    - practically O(1) in computation: due to novel aggregation & amortization techniques, the amortized cost per-party
      remains constant up to *thousands of parties*.

Note: this protocol can easily be used as a traditional Threshold ECDSA protocol by emulating a centralized party
with `0` secrets.

## Tiresias: Scalable, Maliciously Secure Threshold Paillier

A pure-Rust implementation of the
UC-secure ["Tiresias: Large Scale, Maliciously Secure Threshold Paillier"](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/998) paper by:

- Offir Friedman (dWallet Labs)
- Avichai Marmor (dWallet Labs)
- Dolev Mutzari (dWallet Labs)
- Yehonatan Cohen Scaly (dWallet Labs)
- Yuval Spiizer (dWallet Labs)
- Avishay Yanai

This is an implementation of the *threshold decryption* protocol only.
For *distributed key generation*, a protocol like
*Diogenes* ([paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/374), [implementation](https://github.com/JustinDrake/LigeroRSA))
should be used.

It is worth mentioning that we also support the *trusted dealer* setting for which one can see examples in our testing &
benchmarking code that uses `secret_sharing/shamir` to deal a secret.

### Security

This implementation relies on [`crypto_bigint`](https://github.com/RustCrypto/crypto-bigint) for constant-time big
integer arithmetics whenever dealing with key material or any other secret information.

We have gone through a rigorous internal auditing process throughout development, requiring the approval of two
additional cryptographers and one additional programmer in every pull request.
That being said, this code has not been audited by a third party yet; use it at your own risk.

### Performance & Benchmarking

Our code achieves unprecedented scale & performance, with a throughput of about **50 and 3.6 decryptions per _second_**,
when run over a network of **100 and 1000 parties**, respectively.

We have set up an automated GitHub action for benchmarking over an EC2 C6i machine, the result of which could
be [viewed here](https://github.com/odsy-network/tiresias/actions/runs/5363804053/jobs/9731618097).

With the `parallel` feature, we rely on [`rayon`](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon) for data parallelism, which, as
shown theoretically in the paper and experimentally, works extremely well in this scheme.

## group

Group traits for abelian groups in additive notation, designed to resemble the cryptographic/mathematics definition as
accurately as possible.
Traits are hierarchical in nature, and higher-level traits embody more specific properties on top of the ones below.
This allows us to capture shared logic between cryptographic groups in the most generic way possible, so that schemes
and protocols could be designed (e.g. [`maurer`](https://github.com/dwallet-labs/maurer)) to work with any group,
including dynamic, unknown order groups like Paillier, and static, prime-order groups like elliptic curves (e.g.,
secp256k1.)

These traits were designed while keeping the security concern of high-level protocols in mind, and as such are
constant-time by default.

Another key addition is `GroupElement::PublicParameters` which captures the relevant information to hash into the
transcript, as required by Fiat-Shamir transforms.
Another important security (and functionality) aspect of the public parameters is the fact they allow us to separate the
group element `GroupElement` from its value `GroupElement::Value`; the former is a runtime representation, which encodes
necessary information for group operations whereas
the latter solely represents the value, which can be serialized and transported over the wire, to later be instantiated
into the former using the group's public parameter `GroupElement::PublicParameters`.
This is important since group operation must always succeed, however, we must also prevent malicious players from
forcing us to use the wrong groups.
For example, if a malicious prover can force the verifier to use a Paillier group for a modulus, they generated
themselves (and thus know how to factor) they can
bypass verification for incorrect claims, or even derive secrets of other parties.
Instead, the verifier should only receive the value of group elements and instantiate the group element using *their
own public parameters*, which ensure operating in the correct group.

## proof

Trait & helpers for zk-proofs and range proofs.

## homomorphic-encryption

Traits for homomorphic encryption schemes, including a threshold homomorphic decryption schemes.

## commitment

Traits for homomorphic commitment schemes, including Pedersen-based implementations.
Includes implementation for hash-based non-homomorphic commitment using [`merlin::Transcript`].

## maurer

Generic Maurer zero-knowledge proofs for any language ${L = {(x, X) | X = \phi(x)}}$ associated with a group
homomorphism
$\phi(x + y) = \phi(x) + \phi(y)$.

## enhanced-maurer

This crate builds upon the `maurer` crate for zero-knowledge proofs over any language $L = {(x, X) | X = \phi(x)}$
associated with a group homomorphism
$\phi(x + y) = \phi(x) + \phi(y)$ and extends it to an _enhanced_ form, in which range claim(s) are a
part of the statement, as defined in Section 4 of the "2PC-MPC: Threshold ECDSA with Thousands of Parties" paper.
